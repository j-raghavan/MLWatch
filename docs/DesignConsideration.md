### **MLWatch: Design Document**

**Objective**:
Build a modular, extensible, and minimalistic observability tool specifically designed for monitoring AI/ML workloads. The design should ensure that MLWatch is lightweight, easy to integrate, and flexible enough to support new AI frameworks and observability needs.

### **1. Architecture Overview**

**a. Core Components**:
1. **Data Collector**:
   - Collects metrics from models and data pipelines (e.g., training loss, inference latency, GPU/CPU utilization).
   - Supports popular frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

2. **Data Processor**:
   - Aggregates, processes, and analyzes incoming metrics.
   - Can detect model drift, data skew, or other anomalies using statistical techniques.

3. **Storage Layer**:
   - Stores time-series data and logs using minimal storage solutions like SQLite for local use or Prometheus for cloud deployments.

4. **Visualization & API Layer**:
   - Exposes data through RESTful APIs and provides basic visualizations.
   - Integrates with Grafana or Prometheus for complex visualizations.

5. **Plugin System**:
   - Supports easy extension of new data sources, metrics, or storage backends.

**b. Communication between Components**:
- Use lightweight messaging protocols like **gRPC** or **ZeroMQ** to minimize footprint.
- Configurable for local or distributed setups.

### **2. Key Design Goals**

1. **Modularity**:
   - Each component (data collector, processor, storage, and visualization) should be an independent module, allowing for selective enablement and configuration.

2. **Extensibility**:
   - Add new plugins for unsupported frameworks or custom metrics.
   - Implement a Plugin Interface for easy integration of custom models, metrics, and pipelines.

3. **Ease of Maintenance**:
   - Follow standard coding practices (e.g., SOLID principles, PEP8).
   - Separate core logic from framework-specific implementations.

4. **Minimal Footprint**:
   - Optimize resource usage (CPU, memory) to run efficiently in cloud and edge environments.
   - Keep dependencies minimal and avoid large frameworks.

### **3. Component-Level Design**

**a. Data Collector**:
- **Modules**:
  1. **Framework Connectors**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others.
  2. **System Resource Monitors**: Collect CPU, GPU, memory, and I/O metrics.
  3. **Telemetry Agents**: Lightweight agents that push metrics periodically.

- **Design Considerations**:
  - Use Python’s `asyncio` for non-blocking metric collection.
  - Implement a configuration file (`mlwatch.yml`) to specify which models and metrics to monitor.

**b. Data Processor**:
- Implement a real-time data processing pipeline using Python’s `asyncio` or `concurrent.futures`.
- Use **pandas** or **NumPy** for lightweight data manipulation.
- Integrate basic statistical models to detect anomalies (e.g., Z-score, moving average).

**c. Storage Layer**:
- Support different backends (SQLite, Prometheus).
- Use a plug-in architecture to switch between local and remote storage solutions.

**d. Visualization & API Layer**:
- Expose collected metrics through a **REST API** using `FastAPI`.
- Optional integration with Grafana for advanced visualizations.

### **4. Plugin System Design**

**Plugin Interface**:
- Define a standard interface (`PluginInterface`) that all plugins must implement:
  ```python
  class PluginInterface:
      def start(self):
          """Start the plugin"""
          pass

      def stop(self):
          """Stop the plugin"""
          pass

      def collect_metrics(self) -> dict:
          """Collects and returns metrics in dictionary format"""
          pass
  ```

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Framework Plugins**: Implement plugins for TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
  - **Storage Plugins**: Switch between SQLite, Prometheus, or custom databases.

### **5. Implementation Phases**

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality**
   - Implement core components: Data Collector, Processor, and Storage.
   - Add basic support for TensorFlow and PyTorch metrics.

2. **Phase 2: Plugin System & Extensibility**
   - Build a flexible plugin interface.
   - Add support for new data sources (e.g., scikit-learn, ONNX).

3. **Phase 3: Visualization & Alerting**
   - Expose data via REST API.
   - Implement basic alerting for anomalies (email or webhook notifications).

4. **Phase 4: Optimization & Lightweight Enhancements**
   - Profile and optimize resource usage.
   - Add Kubernetes Helm charts for easy deployment.

---

### **6. Tools & Technologies**

- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - `FastAPI` for the API layer.
  - `pandas` for data processing.
  - `Prometheus-client` for storage.
- **Development Tools**: Poetry, Ruff, Black, Pre-commit.

### **7. Risks & Mitigations**

- **High Resource Consumption**: Optimize collectors and minimize polling intervals.
- **Dependency Overload**: Limit third-party libraries and focus on a core set.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure support for a wide range of ML frameworks.
